</head>
<body>
    <h1>Nouns: Rules for Using Nouns</h1>
    <p>A noun is a word that names a person, place, thing, idea, or quality. Nouns can be classified into several categories based on their characteristics and usage. Understanding the different types of nouns and their usage helps in constructing clear and accurate sentences.</p>

    <h2>1. Types of Nouns</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Common Nouns</strong>: General names for people, places, or things (e.g., teacher, city, dog).<br>
            <em>Example:</em> She is a teacher.</li>
        <li><strong>Proper Nouns</strong>: Specific names of people, places, or things, and are always capitalized (e.g., John, Paris, Amazon).<br>
            <em>Example:</em> He lives in Paris.</li>
        <li><strong>Concrete Nouns</strong>: Nouns that can be perceived by the senses, things that can be touched, seen, smelled, etc. (e.g., apple, car, book).<br>
            <em>Example:</em> I found an apple on the table.</li>
        <li><strong>Abstract Nouns</strong>: Nouns that represent ideas, concepts, or qualities that cannot be physically perceived (e.g., love, freedom, happiness).<br>
            <em>Example:</em> She felt a deep sense of freedom.</li>
        <li><strong>Collective Nouns</strong>: Nouns that refer to a group of people, animals, or things considered as a unit (e.g., team, family, herd).<br>
            <em>Example:</em> The team won the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Countable Nouns</strong>: Nouns that can be counted (e.g., cat/cats, book/books).<br>
            <em>Example:</em> I have three cats.</li>
        <li><strong>Uncountable Nouns</strong>: Nouns that cannot be counted because they represent things in bulk or abstract concepts (e.g., water, information, sugar).<br>
            <em>Example:</em> There is too much water in the glass.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Singular and Plural Forms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>General Rule</strong>: Most nouns form the plural by adding -s.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> cat &rarr; cats</li>
        <li><strong>Nouns ending in -s, -x, -z, -ch, -sh</strong>: Add -es.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> box &rarr; boxes, class &rarr; classes</li>
        <li><strong>Nouns ending in consonant + y</strong>: Change -y to -ies.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> baby &rarr; babies</li>
        <li><strong>Irregular Plurals</strong>: Some nouns have irregular plural forms.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> child &rarr; children, mouse &rarr; mice</li>
        <li><strong>Nouns that remain the same in both singular and plural forms:</strong><br>
            <em>Example:</em> sheep &rarr; sheep</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Articles and Nouns</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Indefinite Articles</strong>: Use <em>a</em> or <em>an</em> with singular countable nouns.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> A car, an apple</li>
        <li><strong>Definite Article</strong>: Use <em>the</em> with singular or plural nouns when referring to something specific or known.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> The book on the table is mine.</li>
        <li><strong>No Article</strong>: Do not use an article with uncountable nouns or plural nouns in general contexts.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> Water is essential.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> Books are important.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Possession</h2>
    <p>To show possession:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add ’s to singular nouns (e.g., John's book).</li>
        <li>Add ’ to plural nouns that already end in s (e.g., the girls' room).</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Example:</em> That is John’s book.<br>
    <em>Example:</em> The girls’ room is upstairs.

    <h2>5. Gender-Specific Nouns</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Some nouns are gender-specific and refer to males or females (e.g., actor/actress, waiter/waitress).<br>
            <em>Example:</em> She is an actress.</li>
        <li>Gender-neutral terms are increasingly preferred, such as using firefighter instead of fireman.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Noun Functions in a Sentence</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subject</strong>: A noun that acts as the subject of the sentence.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> The dog is barking.</li>
        <li><strong>Object</strong>: A noun that receives the action in the sentence.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> She fed the cat.</li>
        <li><strong>Complement</strong>: A noun that follows a linking verb and describes the subject.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> He is a doctor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Countable vs Uncountable Nouns</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Countable Nouns</strong>: Pair with words like <em>many</em>, <em>few</em>, <em>several</em>.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> There are many books on the shelf.</li>
        <li><strong>Uncountable Nouns</strong>: Pair with words like <em>much</em>, <em>a little</em>, <em>some</em>.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> She drank much water today.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Compound Nouns</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Single words</strong> (e.g., toothpaste, bedroom)</li>
        <li><strong>Hyphenated words</strong> (e.g., mother-in-law, well-being)</li>
        <li><strong>Separate words</strong> (e.g., post office, swimming pool)</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Example:</em> My mother-in-law is visiting.

    <h2>9. Proper Nouns</h2>
