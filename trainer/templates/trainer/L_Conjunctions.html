    <h1>Rules for Using Conjunctions</h1>

    <p>A conjunction is a word that connects words, phrases, clauses, or sentences. Conjunctions help to form more complex sentences, showing the relationship between ideas or elements within a sentence.</p>

    <h2>Types of Conjunctions:</h2>

    <h3>Coordinating Conjunctions:</h3>
    <p>These conjunctions connect words, phrases, or independent clauses that are of equal importance.</p>
    <p><strong>FANBOYS</strong> (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So)</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For:</strong> Shows cause or reason. <br>Example: She was tired, for she had been working all day.</li>
        <li><strong>And:</strong> Adds similar information. <br>Example: I like coffee and tea.</li>
        <li><strong>Nor:</strong> Presents an alternative negative. <br>Example: She doesn't like cats, nor does she like dogs.</li>
        <li><strong>But:</strong> Shows contrast. <br>Example: He wanted to go, but he was feeling sick.</li>
        <li><strong>Or:</strong> Presents an alternative. <br>Example: Would you prefer tea or coffee?</li>
        <li><strong>Yet:</strong> Shows contrast or unexpected result. <br>Example: She studied hard, yet she failed the test.</li>
        <li><strong>So:</strong> Shows result or consequence. <br>Example: It was raining, so we stayed inside.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Subordinating Conjunctions:</h3>
    <p>These conjunctions connect an independent clause with a dependent clause, showing a relationship between them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples include: although, because, since, if, unless, when, while, as, until, after, before, even though, etc.</li>
        <li>Example: I stayed home because it was raining.</li>
        <li>Example: He will call you when he gets home.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Correlative Conjunctions:</h3>
    <p>These are pairs of conjunctions used to link equivalent elements in a sentence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples include: either...or, neither...nor, both...and, not only...but also, whether...or.</li>
        <li>Example: Either you come with me, or I’ll go alone.</li>
        <li>Example: Not only did she win the race, but also she broke the record.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conjunctive Adverbs:</h3>
    <p>These words function as both conjunctions and adverbs, connecting independent clauses with a semicolon or period and sometimes introducing a transitional element.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples include: however, therefore, moreover, thus, consequently, otherwise, nonetheless.</li>
        <li>Example: I wanted to go to the park; however, it started to rain.</li>
        <li>Example: She didn’t study for the test; therefore, she didn’t pass.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rules for Using Conjunctions:</h2>

    <h3>Coordinate Clauses with Coordinating Conjunctions:</h3>
    <p>Use coordinating conjunctions to link equal elements (e.g., two independent clauses, two words, or two phrases).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: I went to the store, and I bought some fruits.</li>
        <li>Example: She likes both apples and oranges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Subordinate Clauses with Subordinating Conjunctions:</h3>
    <p>Use subordinating conjunctions to connect a dependent clause with an independent clause, showing time, cause, condition, contrast, etc.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: I will go to the park if it stops raining.</li>
        <li>Example: Although it was cold, we went for a walk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Use Correlative Conjunctions Together:</h3>
    <p>Always use both parts of correlative conjunctions together (e.g., either...or, neither...nor).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: Both John and Mary attended the meeting.</li>
        <li>Example: She is neither rich nor famous.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Use Conjunctive Adverbs to Link Sentences:</h3>
    <p>When using conjunctive adverbs, place them after a semicolon and use a comma after the adverb.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: I wanted to go for a walk; however, it started to rain.</li>
        <li>Example: She was tired; therefore, she went to bed early.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Avoid Run-On Sentences:</h3>
    <p>When joining two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction, ensure a comma is used before the conjunction if the clauses are long or complex.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: I love to read books, but I don't have much time these days.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Punctuation with Correlative Conjunctions:</h3>
    <p>Correlative conjunctions do not require additional punctuation between the elements they connect unless needed for clarity.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: Either you call him, or I will.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Avoid Double Conjunctions:</h3>
    <p>Do not use two conjunctions unnecessarily in the same sentence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Incorrect: But and I like ice cream.</li>
        <li>Correct: But I like ice cream.</li>
    </ul>
