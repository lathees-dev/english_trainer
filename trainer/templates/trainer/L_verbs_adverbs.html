    <h1>Rules for Using Verbs</h1>

    <p>A verb is a word that expresses an action, state, or occurrence, and it is essential for forming sentences. Here are the key rules for using verbs:</p>

    <h2>Types of Verbs:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Action Verbs:</strong> Express physical or mental actions (e.g., run, think, eat).</li>
        <li><strong>Linking Verbs:</strong> Connect the subject to a subject complement (e.g., am, is, are, was, were, seem).</li>
        <li><strong>Helping Verbs (Auxiliary Verbs):</strong> Assist the main verb in forming tenses, questions, or negatives (e.g., have, will, can, do).</li>
        <li><strong>Transitive Verbs:</strong> Require an object to complete their meaning (e.g., eat the apple, write a letter).</li>
        <li><strong>Intransitive Verbs:</strong> Do not require an object (e.g., sleep, arrive, laugh).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Verb Tenses:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Present Tense:</strong> Describes actions happening now or general facts (e.g., She walks to school).</li>
        <li><strong>Past Tense:</strong> Describes actions that happened in the past (e.g., He walked to school).</li>
        <li><strong>Future Tense:</strong> Describes actions that will happen (e.g., They will walk to school).</li>
        <li><strong>Present Continuous:</strong> Describes actions happening right now (e.g., She is walking to school).</li>
        <li><strong>Past Continuous:</strong> Describes actions that were happening at a particular time in the past (e.g., He was walking to school).</li>
        <li><strong>Future Continuous:</strong> Describes actions that will be happening in the future (e.g., They will be walking to school).</li>
        <li><strong>Present Perfect:</strong> Describes actions that have been completed at some point before now (e.g., She has walked to school).</li>
        <li><strong>Past Perfect:</strong> Describes actions that were completed before another past action (e.g., He had walked to school).</li>
        <li><strong>Future Perfect:</strong> Describes actions that will be completed by a certain future time (e.g., They will have walked to school).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subject-Verb Agreement:</h2>
    <p>Verbs must agree with the subject in number (singular/plural) and person (1st, 2nd, 3rd person).</p>
    <p>Example: He runs fast (singular), They run fast (plural).</p>

    <h2>Irregular Verbs:</h2>
    <p>Some verbs do not follow the regular pattern of adding -ed for the past tense and past participle. These are called irregular verbs (e.g., go → went → gone, eat → ate → eaten).</p>

    <h2>Modal Verbs:</h2>
    <p>Modal verbs express necessity, possibility, permission, or ability (e.g., can, could, may, might, must, should, would).</p>
    <p>Example: You should study for the test. I can swim.</p>

    <h2>Active and Passive Voice:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Active Voice:</strong> The subject performs the action (e.g., The dog chased the ball).</li>
        <li><strong>Passive Voice:</strong> The subject receives the action (e.g., The ball was chased by the dog).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Imperative Verbs:</h2>
    <p>Imperative verbs give commands, requests, or instructions (e.g., Sit down, Please help me). The subject is usually you and is implied (e.g., Come here means "You come here").</p>

    <h2>Verb Phrases:</h2>
    <p>A verb phrase consists of a main verb and one or more auxiliary verbs (e.g., have been eating, will be going).</p>

    <h2>Phrasal Verbs:</h2>
    <p>A phrasal verb is a combination of a verb and one or more particles (prepositions or adverbs), often changing the meaning of the original verb (e.g., give up, look after, run out of).</p>

    <h2>Conditionals:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>First Conditional:</strong> Real possibility in the present or future (e.g., If it rains, I will stay home).</li>
        <li><strong>Second Conditional:</strong> Hypothetical situation in the present or future (e.g., If I had a car, I would drive to work).</li>
        <li><strong>Third Conditional:</strong> Hypothetical situation in the past (e.g., If I had studied, I would have passed the test).</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Rules for Using Adverbs</h1>

    <p>An adverb is a word that modifies or describes a verb, adjective, or another adverb, providing more detail about how, when, where, or to what extent something happens. Here are the key rules for using adverbs:</p>

    <h2>Types of Adverbs:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Manner:</strong> Describe how an action is performed (e.g., quickly, carefully, loudly).</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Time:</strong> Indicate when an action occurs (e.g., now, later, yesterday).</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Frequency:</strong> Indicate how often an action occurs (e.g., always, never, sometimes).</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Place:</strong> Indicate where an action occurs (e.g., here, there, everywhere).</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Degree:</strong> Modify the intensity or extent of an action or quality (e.g., very, quite, too).</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Probability:</strong> Express how likely something is to happen (e.g., probably, certainly, perhaps).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Placement of Adverbs:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Verb Modification:</strong> Adverbs typically come after the verb (e.g., She sings beautifully).</li>
        <li><strong>Adjective Modification:</strong> Adverbs modify adjectives and usually come before the adjective (e.g., She is incredibly smart).</li>
        <li><strong>Adverb Modification:</strong> When modifying another adverb, the adverb generally comes before the adverb (e.g., He runs very quickly).</li>
        <li><strong>Sentence Placement:</strong> Some adverbs can appear at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence, depending on what they modify (e.g., Yesterday, we went to the park; We often go to the park; She sings loudly).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adverbs of Frequency and Placement:</h2>
    <p>Adverbs of frequency (e.g., always, never, usually) typically go before the main verb (e.g., She always arrives on time), but after "to be" verbs (e.g., He is often late).</p>

    <h2>Degree of Comparison:</h2>
    <p>Adverbs can also be used in comparative and superlative forms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Comparative Adverbs:</strong> Add -er or use more with two-syllable or longer adverbs (e.g., faster, more carefully).</li>
        <li><strong>Superlative Adverbs:</strong> Add -est or use most with two-syllable or longer adverbs (e.g., fastest, most carefully).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Formation of Adverbs:</h2>
    <p>Many adverbs are formed by adding -ly to adjectives (e.g., quick → quickly, happy → happily). Some adverbs, however, have irregular forms (e.g., good → well, fast → fast).</p>

    <h2>Adverbs vs. Adjectives:</h2>
    <p>Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or adverbs (e.g., She runs quickly modifies the verb, She is very smart modifies the adjective, She runs really quickly modifies the adverb). Adjectives modify nouns (e.g., The quick runner modifies the noun "runner").</p>

    <h2>Commonly Confused Adverbs:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hard vs. Hardly:</strong> Hard means with effort or force (e.g., He worked hard). Hardly means barely or scarcely (e.g., He hardly worked).</li>
        <li><strong>Late vs. Lately:</strong> Late means after the expected time (e.g., She arrived late). Lately means recently (e.g., I’ve been busy lately).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Avoid Double Negatives:</h2>
    <p>Avoid using double negatives with adverbs like never or hardly (e.g., I don’t hardly know him should be I hardly know him).</p>

    <h2>Intensifying Adverbs:</h2>
    <p>Adverbs like very, extremely, really, and quite are used to intensify or emphasize the meaning of the adjective or adverb they modify (e.g., She is very smart, He runs extremely fast).</p>
