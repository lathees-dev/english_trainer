    <h1>Rules for Using Pronouns</h1>

    <p>A pronoun is a word that replaces a noun to avoid repetition and enhance clarity. There are several types of pronouns, each serving a different function in the sentence.</p>

    <h2>Types of Pronouns:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Pronouns:</strong> Replace specific nouns referring to people or things.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Subject Pronouns:</strong> I, you, he, she, it, we, they</li>
                <p>Example: She is going to the store.</p>
                <li><strong>Object Pronouns:</strong> me, him, her, us, them</li>
                <p>Example: He gave me the book.</p>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Possessive Pronouns:</strong> Indicate ownership or possession.
            <p>Example: This book is mine.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reflexive Pronouns:</strong> Indicate that the subject and the object of the sentence are the same person or thing.
            <p>Example: She taught herself how to play piano.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Demonstrative Pronouns:</strong> Point out specific things or people.
            <p>Example: This is my favorite book.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Interrogative Pronouns:</strong> Used to ask questions.
            <p>Example: Who is at the door?</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Relative Pronouns:</strong> Used to connect clauses or sentences and refer to a noun mentioned earlier.
            <p>Example: The woman who called is my aunt.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Indefinite Pronouns:</strong> Refer to non-specific people or things.
            <p>Example: Everyone is invited to the party.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reciprocal Pronouns:</strong> Indicate mutual actions or relationships.
            <p>Example: They help each other with their homework.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pronoun Agreement:</h2>

    <p>Pronouns must agree with their antecedents in number (singular/plural), gender, and person.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Number:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: The boy loves his dog (singular).</li>
                <li>Example: The boys love their dog (plural).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Gender:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Sarah put on her coat.</li>
                <li>Example: The dog chased its tail.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Person:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I went to the store.</li>
                <li>Example: We are having a meeting.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Clarity of Reference:</h2>

    <p>Pronouns must clearly refer to their antecedent to avoid ambiguity.</p>
    <p>Example: Anna said Sarah was late (instead of "She was late," which could be confusing).</p>

    <h2>Using Pronouns Correctly:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subject Pronouns:</strong> Use subject pronouns for the subject of a sentence.
            <p>Example: He runs every morning.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Object Pronouns:</strong> Use object pronouns for the object of a verb or preposition.
            <p>Example: Please give it to me.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reflexive Pronouns:</strong> Use reflexive pronouns only when the subject and object are the same.
            <p>Example: She taught herself how to dance.</p>
            <p>(Do not use reflexive pronouns unnecessarily: “Please contact me, not myself.”)</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Demonstrative Pronouns:</strong> Match the noun’s proximity and number.
            <ul>
                <li>Example: This is my house (singular, near).</li>
                <li>Example: Those are my shoes (plural, far).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Possessive Pronouns:</strong> Do not use apostrophes with possessive pronouns.
            <p>Example: The dog wagged its tail (not it’s).</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Indefinite Pronouns:</strong> Some are singular and some are plural.
            <ul>
                <li>Singular: Everyone is invited.</li>
                <li>Plural: Many are absent.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Correct Usage of "Who" vs. "Whom":</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use who as the subject of a sentence or clause.
            <p>Example: Who is coming to the party?</p>
        </li>
        <li>Use whom as the object of a verb or preposition.
            <p>Example: To whom did you speak?</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Avoid Double Pronouns:</h2>
    <p>Avoid using two pronouns unnecessarily.</p>
    <p>Example: "My brother is coming," not "My brother he is coming."</p>
