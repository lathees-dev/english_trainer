    <h1>Rules for Using Adjectives</h1>

    <p>An adjective is a word that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun, adding detail or emphasis. Here are the essential rules for using adjectives:</p>

    <h2>Types of Adjectives:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Descriptive Adjectives:</strong> Describe qualities (e.g., happy, blue, tall).</li>
        <li><strong>Quantitative Adjectives:</strong> Indicate quantity or number (e.g., some, many, three).</li>
        <li><strong>Demonstrative Adjectives:</strong> Point to specific nouns (e.g., this, that, these, those).</li>
        <li><strong>Possessive Adjectives:</strong> Show ownership (e.g., my, your, his, her).</li>
        <li><strong>Interrogative Adjectives:</strong> Used in questions (e.g., which, what, whose).</li>
        <li><strong>Comparative Adjectives:</strong> Compare two things (e.g., smarter, bigger).</li>
        <li><strong>Superlative Adjectives:</strong> Compare three or more things (e.g., smartest, biggest).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Placement of Adjectives:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Before a Noun:</strong> Most adjectives come before the noun (e.g., a tall building).</li>
        <li><strong>After a Linking Verb:</strong> Some adjectives follow linking verbs (e.g., The sky is blue).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Order of Multiple Adjectives:</h2>
    <p>When using multiple adjectives, the general order is: opinion, size, age, shape, color, proper adjective, purpose (e.g., a beautiful big old round green French wooden table).</p>

    <h2>Agreement in Number:</h2>
    <p>Adjectives generally do not change form for singular or plural nouns in English (e.g., big dog and big dogs).</p>

    <h2>Comparative and Superlative Forms:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add -er for one-syllable adjectives (e.g., taller), or use more for two-syllable adjectives or more (e.g., more beautiful).</li>
        <li>Add -est for one-syllable adjectives (e.g., tallest), or use most for two or more syllables (e.g., most beautiful).</li>
        <li><strong>Irregular forms:</strong> good → better → best, bad → worse → worst.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Avoid Double Adjectives:</h2>
    <p>Avoid using two adjectives that mean the same thing (e.g., She is a lovely beautiful girl should be She is a lovely girl).</p>

    <h2>Adjectives with “-ed” and “-ing”:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>-ed adjectives:</strong> Describe feelings (e.g., bored, excited, tired).</li>
        <li><strong>-ing adjectives:</strong> Describe characteristics of things (e.g., boring, exciting, tiring).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example: I am bored vs. This is a boring movie.</p>

    <h2>Adjective + Noun Combinations:</h2>
    <p>Adjectives can form compound nouns (e.g., snow-white, well-known, high-pitched), often hyphenated.</p>

    <h2>Demonstrative and Possessive Adjectives:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Demonstrative Adjectives:</strong> Point to specific nouns (e.g., this, that, these, those).</li>
        <li><strong>Possessive Adjectives:</strong> Indicate possession (e.g., my, your, his, her).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Intensifiers:</h2>
    <p>Intensifiers modify adjectives to strengthen or weaken their meaning (e.g., very, extremely, quite, somewhat).</p>
    <p>Example: She is extremely talented.</p>

    <h2>Adjective Pairs and Comparison:</h2>
    <p>Use more and most with two or more syllable adjectives (e.g., more interesting, most expensive), and -er and -est with one-syllable adjectives (e.g., smaller, smallest).</p>
