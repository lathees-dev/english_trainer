    <h1>Tenses</h1>

    <p>Tenses are used to indicate the time of an action or event, showing whether it occurred in the past, is occurring in the present, or will occur in the future. Understanding tenses is essential for clear communication and proper sentence structure. Tenses are classified into three main categories: past, present, and future, each of which has different forms.</p>

    <h2>1. Past Tense:</h2>
    <p>The past tense describes actions or events that were completed in the past. It can also describe habitual actions or states that were true in the past.</p>

    <h3>Forms of Past Tense:</h3>

    <h4>Simple Past Tense:</h4>
    <p>Describes a completed action that happened at a specific time in the past.</p>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong> Add -ed to regular verbs. Irregular verbs have unique past forms.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular verbs: She walked to the store.</li>
        <li>Irregular verbs: He ate an apple yesterday.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Past Continuous Tense:</h4>
    <p>Describes an action that was happening at a specific time in the past or was interrupted by another action.</p>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong> Use "was/were" + verb + -ing.</p>

    </ul>

    <h4>Past Perfect Tense:</h4>
    <p>Describes an action that was completed before another action in the past.</p>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong> Use "had" + past participle of the verb.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>She had finished her homework before the movie started.</li>
        <li>By the time I arrived, they had already left.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Past Perfect Continuous Tense:</h4>
    <p>Describes an ongoing action that was happening in the past before another action started.</p>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong> Use "had been" + verb + -ing.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>He had been studying for hours when I called him.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>2. Present Tense:</h2>
